# Tic-tac-toe-the-odin-project

# All the important info about the game is commented in the code

# Most important things to take care are:

# A player is chosen randomly

# On clicking of a square its inner text changes to either X or O

# A square cannot be clicked again after initial click

# Track the number of squares selected and if no winner is found declare a draw

# Write a function that tracks the winner, it will have if....else statements

# Display the winner or a draw accordingly.

# Have a restart button after the game is completed.
